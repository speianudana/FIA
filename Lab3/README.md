## Introduction - the project's aim

A program that could predict the price of an apartment given a set of characteristics of the apartment
complex it is part of. You get your hands on some unformatted historical data about apartment
complexes on the space station and their prices. The old man who supplied the data said that
the fields that you might be interested are complexAge in column 3, totalRooms in column 4,
totalBedrooms in column 5, complexInhabitants in column 6, apartmentsNr in column 7 and
medianCompexValue in column 9.
