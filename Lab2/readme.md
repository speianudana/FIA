## Introduction - the project's aim

In their neighboring system, starships are being attacked by some strange creatures, living on asteroids and thrusting themselves towards peopleâ€™s ships. There is a need for some expertise to create a simulation of these attacks, to teach pilots how to deal with these creatures. 
Solanum tuberosum exhibits flocking behavior when undisturbed. The trigger that switches between behaviors is when the ship fires once which means that the ship is attacking them. Solanum tuberosum understands the attacking behavior of the ship and attacks the ship in flocks of asteroids. When the ship is destroyed(loses one life) Solanum tuberosum returns asteroids to their normal flocking behavior.

## Technologies
* Python 3.7
* Numpy
